# Movie-Recommendation-System

This project has been developed using python on Jupyter notebook.

It is based on model based collaborative filtering technique.
Here the users are recommended new movies in accordance to their ratings and ratings given by other users.
A correlation between the ratings of various users is found and finally new movies are recommended.
